                <h3><u>Current</u></h3>
                <p class="ms-2">I am an aspiring full-stack developer, jazz musician, mathematician and educator. I
                    recently completed four months of intesive training at the <a
                        href="https://codefactory.wien/en/home-en/" target="_blank">Code Factory</a> (Sept-Dec 2021) in
                    Vienna where
                    I live with my partner and two children. Below are links to some projects built during the
                    course that showcase my work on both the front and back ends. I graduated from Code Factory with
                    <i>summa cum laude</i> having achieved 100% in every assignment except one (in which 96% had to
                    suffice :-). I am a keen learner at home in a variety of disciplines
                    spanning mathematics and music. I am looking for a role in which I can continue learning
                    whilst providing value and quality to my employers and clients. I am currently seeking a junior
                    developer role preferably with full-stack responsibilities but I am
                    open to front or back-end positions as well depending upon the specifics.
                    I bring my own original approach to web design based on my autodidactic first steps into the
                    field.
                    <hr>
                <h3><u>Past Decade</u></h3>
                For the last 9 years I have worked as a freelance musician and even retrained as a music teacher
                (completing my third first-class university degree) in Vienna between 2017-2021. During this time I have
                composed
                and performed music in a variety of contexts <a href="https://www.andrewgorman.art"><i>documented
                        here</i></a> including founding and leading the <a
                    href="https://www.donkipper.com">award-winning world-music ensemble, <i>Don Kipper</i></a>
                As a music and mathematics educator I have worked for;
                <li>Keystone Tutors, London (2009-)</li>
                <li>J.S Bach Musikschule, Vienna (2020-2021)</li>
                <li>Superar, Vienna(2017-2020)</li>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3><u>Education and skills</u></h3>
                <p>(...in some cases a necessary distinction). I hold three first-class university degrees in
                    Mathematics with Foreign Languages (a Bachelor of Science degree, BSc for which I won <a
                        href="../contact.php">a scholarship
                        to the University of Manchester in 2005</a> ), Musical Composition (MMus) and Music Education
                    (BA) each
                    of which are connected to aspects of my portfolio career. I believe Jazz and other improvised music
                    to entail the ultimate marriage of art and science and for this reason I have dedicated years of my
                    life to their performance and study. My main instrument is the violin but I am also a competent
                    guitarist and pianist. Besides English I am fluent in German and French. Most recently I completed
                    an intensive 4-month Full-Stack Web Development Course at the Code Factory in Vienna from which I
                    graduated with <i>summa cum laude</i> having completed 12 of 13 coding assignements with 100% and
                    the other with 96%. I appreciate of course that I still have comparatively little experience with
                    coding but I now feel confident that I posess both the stamina and capacity to learn fast that are
                    required to move quickly into a position where I am providing a valuable service to any employer.
                    What I lack in years of experience I believe I make up in having made significant progress in my
                    life in the art of learning.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3><u>Teaching</u></h3>
                Although leaving the world of mathematics following my BSc studies in 2009 I have taught the subject up
                to pre-University level as a <a href="https://www.keystonetutors.com/tutors/294-andrew"><i>private
                        tutor</i></a>. During this time I taught myself Python3 in order to bypass the need for
                investing in expensive statistical calculators and I extend this knowledge to any students who wish to
                learn programming skills alongside their maths.
                I have also taught violin and jazz improvisation both privately and in association with music schools
                since 2016.
                <hr>
                <h3><u>Volunteer work</u></h3>
                Since 2017 I have worked together with <a href="https://www.livemusicnow.at/"> <i>Live Music Now</i></a>
                in Vienna providing music lessons to refugees and to both children and adults from disadvantaged
                backgrounds. Initially I was engaged as a violin teacher but between Sept 2020- Jun 2021 I led the
                branch of the project at my ex-university, the JAM Music LAB in a professional role as an employed
                teacher (Dozent).
